# My Politics
Congress can seem like a very abstract institution to the average American because of the many Congressmen and Congresswomen and the various bills and actions that are taken. While the media is a way we can get disparate news, it is hard to compile information on Congress as a whole.
Thankfully, Sunlight Congress API makes information about Congressmen, bills, and votes publicly available. The goal of this project is to visually render that data in a way that is structured and informative.
